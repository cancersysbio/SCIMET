# Spatial Computational Inference of MEtastatic Timing (SCIMET)
SCIMET is a computational inference framework based on primary tumor/metastasis paired WES data, spatial tumor modeling, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of metastasis (Hu et al. 2019, upcoming). 1. SCIMET can infer the mode of tumor evolution (effectively neutral or strong selection) in paired primary tumor and metastasis. 2. SCIMET can infer the two key parameters of metastasis evolutionm, a) mutation rate; b) malignant clone size at the time of dissemination
