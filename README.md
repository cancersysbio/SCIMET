# Spatial Computational Inference of MEtastatic Timing (SCIMET)
SCIMET is a computational inference framework based on the WES data of paired primary tumor/metastasis, spatial tumor modeling, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to quantify the evolutionary dynamics of metastasis (Hu et al. 2019, upcoming). 1. SCIMET can infer the mode of tumor evolution (effectively neutral or strong selection) in paired primary tumor and metastasis. 2. SCIMET can infer two key parameters of metastasis evolution: a) mutation rate and b) malignant clone size at the time of dissemination
